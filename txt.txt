usage: python -m build [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--sdist] [--wheel]
                       [--outdir PATH] [--skip-dependency-check]
                       [--no-isolation | --installer {pip,uv}]
                       [--config-setting KEY[=VALUE] | --config-json
                       JSON_STRING]
                       [srcdir]

    A simple, correct Python build frontend.

    By default, a source distribution (sdist) is built from {srcdir}
    and a binary distribution (wheel) is built from the sdist.
    This is recommended as it will ensure the sdist can be used
    to build wheels.

    Pass -s/--sdist and/or -w/--wheel to build a specific distribution.
    If you do this, the default behavior will be disabled, and all
    artifacts will be built from {srcdir} (even if you combine
    -w/--wheel with -s/--sdist, the wheel will be built from {srcdir}).

positional arguments:
  srcdir                source directory (defaults to current directory)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version, -V         show program's version number and exit
  --verbose, -v         increase verbosity
  --sdist, -s           build a source distribution (disables the default
                        behavior)
  --wheel, -w           build a wheel (disables the default behavior)
  --outdir PATH, -o PATH
                        output directory (defaults to {srcdir}\dist)
  --skip-dependency-check, -x
                        do not check that build dependencies are installed
  --no-isolation, -n    disable building the project in an isolated virtual
                        environment. Build dependencies must be installed
                        separately when this option is used
  --installer {pip,uv}  Python package installer to use (defaults to pip)
  --config-setting KEY[=VALUE], -C KEY[=VALUE]
                        settings to pass to the backend. Multiple settings can
                        be provided. Settings beginning with a hyphen will
                        erroneously be interpreted as options to build if
                        separated by a space character; use ``--config-
                        setting=--my-setting -C--my-other-setting``
  --config-json JSON_STRING
                        settings to pass to the backend as a JSON object. This
                        is an alternative to --config-setting that allows
                        complex nested structures. Cannot be used together
                        with --config-setting
